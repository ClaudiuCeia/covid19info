This includes a historical view of all meaninful events and stage changes at the government and private level. 

## General Assessments
   * Took longer to spring into action. 
   * Enough data and proof was available to change to stage 2 and then 3 much earlier
   * Government mostly skeptical initially 
   * People mostly skeptical initially (specailly midwest)
   * Conservative news media mostly skeptical intially and believed it was perpetraited by the liberal media
   * Stage 1 period was more dramatic due to the amount of hysteria shared thorugh news outlets which contributed to the increasing skeptism.
