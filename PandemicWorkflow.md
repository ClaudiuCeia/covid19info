# Pandemic Workflow 

Pandemic workflow and sequence of events based on what we saw in China , HK, South Korea, Taiwan. By knowing the stage that you are in it will help calm people down and encourage your family, friends and government to do something. 

1) Oh shit moment this is serious
   * panic
   * misinformation
   * confusion
   * government not acting
   * hospitalizations
   * community spread
   * rushing to buy masks, sanitizers and sometimes toillet paper. 

2) Containment
   * social distance
   * shutdown schools, concerts, all social gatherings 
   * online school, remote working
   * people are actually listening and learning

3) Assess who is sick
   * mass testing for weeks or months / everyone who has symptoms
   * temperature checks on every corner, grocery stores, malls, airports, buildings
   * big lines
   * rationing
   * more shock

4) Continue until numbers are stabilized
   * everyone starts to adapts to the changes,
   * we know exactly where the virus is
   * sick & recovered people are monitored
   * this becomes routine / normal 

5) Massive decontamination efforts
   * public transportation
   * hospitals
   * theaters

Repeat 3-5 until the virus is gone
